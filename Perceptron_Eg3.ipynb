    "The first parameter, learn_speed, is used to control how fast our perceptron will learn. The lower the value, the longer it will take to learn, but the less one value will change each overall weight. If this parameter is too high, our program will change its weights so quickly that they are inaccurate. On the other hand, if learn_speed is too low, it will take forever to train the perceptron accurately. A good value for this parameter is about 0.01-0.05.\n",

    "Our perceptron has no use if we don't actually train it. We will do this by coding a quick Trainer class. In this example, we will train our perceptron to tell us whether a point is above a line or below a line. Our line, in this case, is represented by the equation y = 0.5x + 10. Once you know how to train a perceptron to recognize a line, you can represent x and y as different attributes, and above or below the line as results of those attributes.\n",

You could then use this perceptron to predict whether or not a student will get accepted into Harvard based on their GPA and ACT scores.\n",

    "As you can see, the initializer for the Trainer class creates a perceptron with three inputs and a learning speed of 0.01. The first two inputs are x and y, but what is the last input? This is another core concept of neural networks and machine learning. That last input will always set to 1. The weight that corresponds to it will determine how it affects our line. For example, if you look back at our equation: y = 0.5x + 10, we need some way of representing the y-intercept, 10. We do this by creating a third input that increases or decreases based on the weight that the perceptron trains it to have. Think of it as a threshold that helps the perceptron understand that the line is adjusted 10 units upward.\n",

    "\n",
    "In each iteration of the loop, we create a point, determine if it is above or below the line, and then feed those inputs into the perceptron's train method. First, x and y coordinates are randomly generated between -250 and 250. Next, we find where the y coordinate would be on the line for that x value to see if our point is above the line. For example, if we picked a point at (1, 3), then we should get the y coordinate of the line for the x value of 3. We do this with our f function. If our random y coordinate is higher than the corresponding y coordinate on the line, we know that our random coordinate is above the line.\n",
